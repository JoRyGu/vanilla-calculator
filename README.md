# vanilla-calculator
This small app is a simple calculator (similar to what you'd find with your Mac's Calculator.app) created with pure vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks, libraries, or packages were used. It was created to test my problem-solving skills using JavaScript.

### Demo

You can find the working demo for this project at: https://jorygu.github.io/vanilla-calculator/

### HTML

The HTML used in this project was just a very basic skeleton that I used to mark up the necessary buttons and the display.
I utilized one primary container div and one inner container div for each row of buttons.

### CSS

I utilized the following as a very basic style reset for the project:

```CSS
html, body, button {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: "Libre Franklin", sans-serif;
}
```

Just enough to help prevent unnecessary conflict with my custom margins and padding and to set the general feel of the font size and style I wanted to use.
